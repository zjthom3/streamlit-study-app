        "intro_text": """Integers are commonly represented in base 10, the decimal number system, in which the number 123 means “1 hundred, 2 tens, and 3 ones.” However, there are also other ways to represent numbers. Number systems such as binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16) each use a different positional value for their digits. Extremely large or extremely small numbers, whether integers or floating point values, can also be represented using scientific notation.

By the end of this video, you will know more about each numbering system and how to convert a decimal number to binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers. Think about these questions while watching the video:

1. What number is deci associated with?
2. What system is used for everyday counting?
3. What number is bi associated with?
4. What booleans are 0 and 1 associated with?
5. What number is octa associated with?
6. What does hexa mean?
7. What number is the letter D associated with in the hexadecimal system?
8. What is the binary number for 125(base 10)?""",
